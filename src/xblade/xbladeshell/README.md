# Xbladeshell

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

The application is hosted on Azure Static Web Apps and can be accessed at:

**Live URL:** [https://salmon-ocean-0fa567f00.azurestaticapps.net](https://salmon-ocean-0fa567f00.azurestaticapps.net)

## Features

### Sample Component
The application includes a comprehensive **Sample Component** that demonstrates:
- Loading UI elements from `elements.json` via API call
- Displaying 23+ different UI element types with their properties
- Organizing elements by categories (inputs, display, containers, data, actions)
- Responsive design with loading states and error handling
- Navigation available at `/sample` route

To view the sample component, visit: [https://salmon-ocean-0fa567f00.azurestaticapps.net/sample](https://salmon-ocean-0fa567f00.azurestaticapps.net/sample)

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
